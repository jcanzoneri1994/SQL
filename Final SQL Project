#In this project, I downloaded a database called chinook, a data media store that includes tables for customers, invoices, albums, artists, etc.
# I then analyzed the data and answered questions below about the data in the tables in the dataset.

#1. Show customers who are not in the US.
SELECT firstname, lastname, customerid, country
FROM chinook.customers
WHERE country <> "USA";

#2. Show only the customers from Brazil.
SELECT firstname, lastname, country
FROM chinook.customers
WHERE country = "Brazil";

#3. Find the invoices of customers who are from Brazil.  Include the customer's full name, invoice ID, date of the invoice, and billing country.
SELECT cust.firstname, cust.lastname, inv.invoiceid, inv.billingcountry, inv.invoicedate
FROM chinook.invoices inv
LEFT JOIN chinook.customers cust
ON inv.customerid = cust.customerid
WHERE country = "Brazil";

#4. Show the employees who are sales agents.
SELECT *
FROM chinook.employees
WHERE title = "Sales Support Agent";

#5. Find a unique/distinct list of billing countries from the invoice table.
SELECT DISTINCT billingcountry
FROM chinook.invoices;

#6. Provide a query that shows the invoices associated with each sales agent.  The resulting tables should include the sales agent's full name.
SELECT emp.firstname, emp.lastname, inv.invoiceid
FROM chinook.customers cust
JOIN chinook.invoices inv
ON inv.invoiceid = cust.customerid
JOIN chinook.employees emp
ON emp.employeeid = cust.supportrepid;

#7. Show the invoice total, customer name, country, and sales agent name for all invoices and customers.
SELECT inv.invoiceid, inv.total, cust.firstname, cust.lastname, emp.firstname, emp.lastname
FROM chinook.customers cust
JOIN chinook.invoices inv
ON inv.invoiceid = cust.customerid
JOIN chinook.employees emp
ON emp.employeeid = cust.supportrepid;

#8. How many invoices were there in 2009?
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM chinook.invoices
WHERE invoicedate LIKE '2009%';

#9. What are the total sales for 2009?
SELECT SUM(total)
FROM chinook.invoices
WHERE invoicedate BETWEEN '2009-01-01' AND '2009-21-31';

#10. Write a query that includes the purchased track name with each invoice line ID.
SELECT t.name, i.invoicelineid
FROM chinook.invoice_items i
JOIN chinook.tracks t
ON i.trackid = t.trackid;

#11. Write a query that includes the purchased track name and artist name with each invoice line ID.
SELECT t.name AS track, ar.name AS artist, i.invoicelineid 
FROM chinook.invoice_items i
LEFT JOIN chinook.tracks t
ON i.trackid = t.trackid
INNER JOIN chinook.albums a
ON a.albumid = t.albumid
LEFT JOIN chinook.artists ar
ON ar.artistid = a.artistid;

#12. Provide a query that shows all the tracks, and include the album name, media type, and genre.
SELECT t.name AS track, a.title AS album, m.name AS media, g.name AS genre
FROM chinook.tracks t
JOIN chinook.albums a
ON a.albumid = t.albumid
JOIN chinook.media_types m
ON m.mediatypeid = t.mediatypeid
JOIN chinook.genres g
ON g.genreid = t.genreid;

#13. Show the total sales made by each sales agent.
SELECT e.firstname, e.lastname, ROUND(SUM(i.total), 2) AS 'Total Sales'
FROM chinook.employees e
JOIN chinook.customers c
ON c.supportrepid = e.employeeid
JOIN chinook.invoices i
ON i.customerid = c.customerid
WHERE e.title = 'Sales Support Agent'
GROUP BY e.firstname;

#14. Which sales agent made the most dollars in sales in 2009?
SELECT e.firstname, e.lastname, ROUND(SUM(i.total), 2) AS 'Total Sales'
FROM chinook.employees e
JOIN chinook.customers c
ON c.supportrepid = e.employeeid
JOIN chinook.invoices i
ON i.customerid = c.customerid
WHERE e.title = 'Sales Support Agent'
AND i.invoicedate BETWEEN '2009-01-01' AND '2009-12-31'
GROUP BY e.firstname
ORDER BY 'Total Sales' DESC LIMIT 1;
